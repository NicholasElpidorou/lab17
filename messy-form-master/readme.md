# An interesting but messy form

1. Place all the JavaScript in the HTML in a .js file and check it works.
2. Replace the JavaScript in the HTML with event listeners in the .js file.
3. Style the form with CSS to lay it out in a pleasing way.
3. Style the email and website fields to take advantage of the native browser validation funcions.

Don't worry about actually submitting the form.
